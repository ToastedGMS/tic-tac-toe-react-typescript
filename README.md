# Basic Tic Tac Toe implementation using Vite with React + Typescript

## Introduction

This project is my first introduction to Typescript, so I wanted to build something easy and quick to get a basic understanding of the language.

The idea here was to build something simple while consuming a minimal ammount of tutorials. In other ways, figuring out Typescript from documentation only.

The inspiration for this little code exercise came from a job application proccess which required Ts, which I was not familiar with. I decided to use the one week deadline to actually understand the tools I needed to use before tackling the challenge, which proved to be the best approach I could have decided to take.

## What I learned

Typescript really isn't the monster I believed it to be. It's basically Javascript, but with defined types. Sure this project didn't dive deeply into Ts as a concept, but for a brief introduction, that's what I took home from this.

It will definetely help making my code more concise and less error prone in the future. Also the intellisense and the IDE embedded auto-documentation are advantages that go far beyond my expectations, as these helpe future proving code, making other developers work easier, and overall speeding up the whole coding proccess. Paired with TDD, this can be a powerful way of developing my projects in the future.

## Running the app

**If you're dying to play Tic-Tac-Toe, you can run this app by following the next few commands**
**Remember that I didn't really take out time to style this thoroughly.**

Make sure you have Node.js (v16 or later) and npm (or yarn) installed. Then follow these steps:

```
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ts.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ts

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, open your browser and head to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

And you're ready to challenge a friend to a classic battle of Xs and Os!
