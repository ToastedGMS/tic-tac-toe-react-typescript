# Basic Tic Tac Toe implementation using Vite with React + Typescript

This project is my first introduction to Typescript, so I wanted to build something easy and quick to get a basic understanding of the language.

The idea here was to build something simple while consuming a minimal ammount of tutorials. In other ways, figuring out Typescript from documentation only.

The inspiration for this little code exercise came from a job application proccess which required Ts, which I was not familiar with. I decided to use the one week deadline to actually understand the tools I needed to use before tackling the challenge, which proved to be the best approach I could have decided to take.
